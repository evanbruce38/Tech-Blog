  ## Description
  
  * For this assignment I was given no starter code and tasked with creating a fullstack tech blog. I have provided a link to the project deployed on heroku. This tech blog allows a user to sign up or login, then write comments they have on anything related to tech. The project saves a users login info and encrypts their password for protection.  For this assignment we used express, bcrypt, sequelize, node, dotenv, and handlebars.
